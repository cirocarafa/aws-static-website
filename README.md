# AWS Static Website with S3 and CloudFront

This is my first cloud project 🚀  
I created a simple static website hosted on **Amazon S3** and distributed with **Amazon CloudFront** to enable HTTPS and caching.

## 🔹 Project Overview
- **Amazon S3** → used to host a static `index.html` file.
- **Bucket Policy** → configured for public read access.
- **Amazon CloudFront** → added as CDN for performance and HTTPS support.
- **Default Root Object** → set to `index.html` so the site loads correctly from the root domain.

## 🔹 Live Demo

## 🔹 Files
- `index.html` → main webpage with a simple "HELLO AWS!" message.
